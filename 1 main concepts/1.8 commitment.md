| [[4.3 Increment\|Increment]]             | [[5.3 Definition of Done\|Definition of Done]] |
[^successful-use]: "Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^each-artifact]: "Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured: For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal. For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal. For the Increment it is the Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]
