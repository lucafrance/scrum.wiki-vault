The Definition of Done (DoD) is the [[1.8 commitment]] for the [[Increment]][^each-artifact]. A [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog item]] selected for the [[Sprint]] becomes an [[Increment]] when it meets the Definition of Done[^the-moment-a-pbi].

[^each-artifact]: "Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured: \[...\] For the Increment it is the Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^the-moment-a-pbi]: "The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born."[^scrum-guide-2020]

If available, the [[1.5 Scrum Team]] uses a Definition of Done provided by the [[organization]]. If not, they define their own Definition of Done[^dod-organization].

[^dod-organization]: "If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Developers]] are accountable for adhering to the Definition of Done. When multiple [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] work on the same, they must agree and adhere to the same Definition of Done[^specific-skills-needed][^developers-are-required].

[^specific-skills-needed]: "The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for: \[...\] Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\[...\]"[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^developers-are-required]: "The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]
