The Daily Scrum takes place every workday of the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] participate to the Daily Scrum. The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] or the [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] should participate as [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] if they have active items in the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]][^daily-scrum-15min].

Agenda[^purpose-of-daily]:
- progress towards the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]],
- [[1.3 Scrum theory|adapt]] the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] accordingly.

The [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] can be further updated throughout the day[^daily-not-only-time].

[^daily-scrum-15min]: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^purpose-of-daily]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^daily-not-only-time]: "The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work."[^scrum-guide-2020]

> [!note]
>The Daily Scrum is not a status meeting. Information should be shared only as long as it's functional to achieve the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]]. The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] don't (necessarily) want to report what they're doing to a superior, they want to cooperate to achieve the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] together[^daily-not-status1][^daily-not-status2].

[^daily-not-status1]: [Scrum.org - Scrum Myths: Daily Scrum Is Not a Status Meeting](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-myths-daily-scrum-not-status-meeting) by [Stephanie Ockerman](https://www.scrum.org/stephanie-ockerman) (retrieved on 2025-06-26)
[^daily-not-status2]: [Scrum Alliance - Daily Scrum](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/the-daily-scrum) "The daily scrum is not a status meeting or status report. The purpose isn’t for a scrum master, manager, or stakeholder to see who is on schedule and who is behind; instead, it’s an opportunity for self-managing team members to synchronize with one another." (retrieved on 2025-06-26)

The Daily Scrum is timeboxed to 15 minutes[^daily-scrum-15min]. The [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] ensures that the Daily Scrum takes place and stays within the timebox[^scrum-master-events].

[^scrum-master-events]:"The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including: \[...\] Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox."[^scrum-guide-2020]

In general, the [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] recommends for the [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum events]] to always take place at the same time and place[^optimally-all-events]. For the Daily Scrum specifically this is mandatory[^daily-scrum-15min].

[^optimally-all-events]: "Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] does not mandate any particular structure for the meeting. The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] can structure it as they please as long as they [[1.4 Scrum Values|focus]] on the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] and the progress towards it for the day. The [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] can help the [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] have a productive Daily Scrum[^devs-can-select-structure][^scrum-master-productive].

[^devs-can-select-structure]:"The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management."[^scrum-guide-2020]

Ideally, the Daily Scrum eliminates the need for other meetings[^dailys-improve].

[^dailys-improve]: "Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Daily Scrum and Nexus

In the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]], the Daily Scrum takes place after to the [[N3.3 Nexus Daily Scrum|Nexus Daily Scrum]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] focuses on the integration of their [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] with the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]][^purpose-nexus-daily]. Despite the additional focus, the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] should still address the progress towards their [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] in the Daily Scrum[^nexus-inherits-scrum].

[^nexus-inherits-scrum]: "The Nexus framework inherits the purpose and intent of the Scrum framework as documented in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/). Scaled Scrum is still Scrum. Nexus does not change the core design or ideas of Scrum, or leave out elements, or negate the rules of Scrum. Doing so covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^purpose-nexus-daily]: "The purpose of the Nexus Daily Scrum is to identify any integration issues and inspect progress toward the Nexus Sprint Goal. Appropriate representatives from the Scrum Teams attend the Nexus Daily Scrum, inspect the current state of the integrated Increment, and identify integration issues and newly discovered cross-team dependencies or impacts. Each Scrum Team’s Daily Scrum complements the Nexus Daily Scrum by creating plans for the day, focused primarily on addressing the integration issues raised during the Nexus Daily Scrum."[^nexus-guide-2021]
