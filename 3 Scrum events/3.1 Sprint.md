The [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] is the main [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum event]]. All the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]]'s work happens within the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]], including the other [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum events]][^all-work-sprint]. Sprints have a fixed length of one month of less to improve [[1.4 Scrum Values|focus and consistency]] of the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]][^sprint-focus-consistency].

[^all-work-sprint]: "The Sprint is a container for all other events." "All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-focus-consistency]:"Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency." "They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency."[^scrum-guide-2020]

There is always an ongoing [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. Every Sprint after the first one starts as soon as the previous Sprint finishes[^sprint-end], and ends with the [[3.5 Sprint Retrospective|Sprint Retrospective]][^sprint-end]. There is one exception: only the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] can decide to cancel the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] if the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] becomes obsolete[^sprint-cancelled].

[^sprint-start]: "A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-end]: "The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-cancelled]: "A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

For each [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]], there can be multiple [[4.3 Increment|increments]][^multiple-increments]. The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] are [[1.8 commitment|committed]] in creating at least one[^developers-definition].

[^multiple-increments]: "Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^developers-definition]: "Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

During the Sprint:
- "Quality does not decrease"[^scrum-guide-2020].
- The [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] does not change[^po-devs-changes].
- "No changes are made that would endanger the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]]"[^scrum-guide-2020].
- If necessary, the [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] negotiate the scope of the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] with the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]][^po-devs-changes].
- If necessary, the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] is refined by the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] or their delegates[^refinement-as-needed][^po-accountable-refinement].

[^po-devs-changes]: "If the work turns out to be different than they expected, \[the Developers\] collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^refinement-as-needed]: During the Sprint: \[...\] The Product Backlog is refined as needed \[...\].
[^po-accountable-refinement]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management \[...\]." "The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others."[^scrum-guide-2020]
## Sprint duration

The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] specifies that each Sprint should last one month of less, but there is no mandated minimum[^scrum-guide-2020].

Shorter Sprints reduce complexity, reduce risk, and allow more chances for [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspection]][^shorter-sprints][^help-inspection]. The Sprint should be long enough for the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] to create at least an [[4.3 Increment|Increment]][^increment-sprint-accountability].

[^help-inspection]:"To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^shorter-sprints]:"Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame."
[^increment-sprint-accountability]: "The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

If the Sprint is too long, the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] is more likely to become obsolete during the Sprint[^sprint-too-long]. If so, that is the only instance where the Sprint can be ended in advance[^sprint-cancelled].

[^sprint-too-long]:"When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Sprint forecasts

Any form of forecasting by the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] be based on [[1.3 Scrum theory|Scrum theory]], as in learning from past events. The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] does not mandate any particular forecasting technique, the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] is free to use whatever it please[^forecast-empiricism][^lucafeu-metrics].

[^forecast-empiricism]: "Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^lucafeu-metrics]: [lucaf.eu - The metrics that Scrum requires you to use](https://lucaf.eu/2025/02/22/scrum-metrics.html)

The regular cadence of the Sprints enables [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspection]] and [[1.3 Scrum theory|adaptation]], which helps improve the forecasts[^sprints-enable-predictability].

[^sprints-enable-predictability]: "Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month."[^scrum-guide-2020]

During the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]], the [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] must forecast how much [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog item]] can be completed within the Sprint and moved to the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]][^step-two-forecast].

[^step-two-forecast]: "Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] can help identifying adequate techniques and improving the forecast.

## Sprint and Nexus

In the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]], the Sprint remains the main event containing all other [[N1.5 Nexus events|Nexus events]]. The [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]] produces at least one [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] per Sprint[^sprint-nexus].

[^sprint-nexus]: "A Sprint in Nexus is the same as in Scrum. The Scrum Teams in a Nexus produce a single Integrated Increment."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-guide-2021]: [[N1.2 Nexus Guide|Nexus Guide (2021)]]
