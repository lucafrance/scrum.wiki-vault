# Sprint Planning

The Sprint Planning is the first [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum event]] of the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The outcome of the Sprint Planning it the the plan for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]], [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] participate to the event, as well people invited for advice[^sprint-plan-initiates][^sprint-backlog-is-plan][^sprint-start][^plan-invitees].

> [!note]
> The Sprint Planning does not start the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]], it is just the first [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum event]] of the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] starts with the end of the previous [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]][^sprint-start].
 
[^sprint-plan-initiates]:"Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-backlog-is-plan]: "The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^plan-invitees]: "The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice."
[^sprint-start]:"A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

Before the Sprint Planning:
	- "The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] items and how they map to the [[5.1 Product Goal|Product Goal]]."[^scrum-guide-2020]
	- The [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] are refined as necessary to be ready[^pbi-refinement].

[^sprint-end]: "The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^pbi-refinement]: "Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities."[^scrum-guide-2020]
The Sprint planning is timeboxed to maximum eight hours for the longest [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] length (one month). For shorter [[3.1 Sprint|Sprints]] it should be less[^sprint-plan-timebox][^sprint-length]. The [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] ensures that the Sprint Planning takes place and stays within the timebox[^scrum-master-events].


[^sprint-length]: "They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-plan-timebox]: "Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^scrum-master-events]:"The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including: \[...\] Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox."[^scrum-guide-2020]
## Sprint Planning agenda

The result of the Sprint Planning is the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]], which includes[^sprint-planning-initiates]
- the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] (why is the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] valuable?);
- the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] selected for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] (what work can be done in the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]?);
- a plan to turn the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] in a valuable [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] (how will the work be done in the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]?).

[^sprint-planning-initiates]:"Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team." "The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog."
### Why is the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] valuable?
The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] proposes how to make progress towards the [[5.1 Product Goal|Product Goal]] during the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]].
The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] defines the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] based on the input from the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] and adds it to the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]]. The [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] communicates to the [[6.2 stakeholders|stakeholders]] *why* the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] is valuable[^topic-one][^product-goal-is].

[^topic-one]: "The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^product-goal-is]: "The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against."[^scrum-guide-2020]
### What work can be done in the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]?
The single source of work for the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] is the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]]. Only the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] that can be [[5.3 Definition of Done|done]] within the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] are considered. The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] discuss with the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] and select the items for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The[[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] [[4.1 Product Backlog|items]] selected for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] become also part of the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] may [[4.1 Product Backlog|refine]] the [[4.1 Product Backlog|items]] further as they are added[^single-source][^pbi-planning][^topic-two].

[^single-source]:"\[The Product Backlog\] is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^pbi-planning]:"Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^topic-two]: "Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence."

The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] improve their [[3.1 Sprint|forecast]] for how much can be be completed during the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] over time as they learn more[^step-two-forecast]. The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] does not mandate any particular [[3.1 Sprint|forecasting]] technique they should use[^lucafeu-metrics].

[^step-two-forecast]: "Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^lucafeu-metrics]: [lucaf.eu - The metrics that Scrum requires you to use](https://lucaf.eu/2025/02/22/scrum-metrics.html)
### How will the work be done in the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]?
The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] choose *how* to turn the selected [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] into an [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] that meets the [[5.3 Definition of Done|Definition of Done]]. The resulting plan is added to the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]]. The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] does not mandate any specific way to structure the plan, it is up to the [[2.1 Developers|Developers]][^topic-three].

[^topic-three]: For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

## Sprint Planning and Nexus

In the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]], the Sprint Planning of the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] is extended by the [[N3.2 Nexus Sprint Planning|Nexus Sprint Planning]][^adds-extends-events].

[^adds-extends-events]: "Nexus adds to or extends the events defined by Scrum. The duration of Nexus events is guided by the length of the corresponding events in the Scrum Guide. They are timeboxed in addition to their corresponding Scrum events."[^nexus-guide-2021]
