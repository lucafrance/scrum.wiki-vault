The Increment is a [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog item]] which meets the [[Definition of Done]][^the-moment-a-pbi][^work-cannot-be]. Each Increment[^an-increment-is] is:
- a valuable improvement towards the [[Product Goal]],
- built on top of previous Increments.

[^an-increment-is]: "An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^the-moment-a-pbi]: "The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^work-cannot-be]: "Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]

For each [[Sprint]], there can be multiple Increments[^multiple-increments]. The [[Developers]] are [[1.8 commitment|committed]] in creating at least one[^developers-definition].

[^multiple-increments]: "Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^developers-definition]: "Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Increment is presented at the [[Sprint Review]] to the participating [[stakeholders]], but it can be delivered before. The [[organization]] can [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspect]] the [[Increment]] at the [[Sprint Review]], giving visibility to some of decisions of the [[Product Owner]][^for-po-succeed][^purpose-sprint-review].

[^for-po-succeed]:For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^purpose-sprint-review]: "The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed."

The [[Scrum Master]] helps "the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value [[Increment|increments]] that meet the [[Definition of Done]]"[^scrum-guide-2020].
