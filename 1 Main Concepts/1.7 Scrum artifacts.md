There are three artifacts in [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]]:
- [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]],
- [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]],
- [[4.3 Increment|Increment]].

The [[1.7 Scrum artifacts|Scrum artifacts]] are functional to the [[1.3 Scrum theory|Scrum theory]] of [[1.3 Scrum theory|transparency]], [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspection]], [[1.3 Scrum theory|adaptation]][^scrum-artifacts-represent].
- They are designed to maximize [[1.3 Scrum theory|transparency]][^scrum-artifacts-represent][^emergent-progess-and-work].
	- The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] is accountable for ensuring the [[1.3 Scrum theory|transparency]] of the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]]. The [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] is visible to anyone in the [[6.1 organization|organization]][^po-accountable-product-backlog][^for-pos-to-succeed].
- They must be [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspected]] regularly to enable [[1.3 Scrum theory|adaptation]]. The [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum events]] provide cadence to help the [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspection]] of the artifacts[^scrum-artifacts-represent][^scrum-artifacts-and-progress].
	- The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] inspect the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] at the [[3.3 Daily Scrum|Daily Scrum]] against the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] (its commitment), and adapt it accordingly[^purpose-daily-scrum].
	- The [[6.1 organization|organization]] can inspect the [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] at the [[3.4 Sprint Review|Sprint Review]]. The [[6.2 stakeholders|stakeholders]] and the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] determine future [[1.3 Scrum theory|adaptations]] based on the [[1.3 Scrum theory|inspection]][^for-pos-to-succeed][^purpose-sprint-review].

[^scrum-artifacts-and-progress]: "The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^scrum-artifacts-represent]: "Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^emergent-progess-and-work]: "The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^po-accountable-product-backlog]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes: \[...\] Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^for-pos-to-succeed]: "For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^purpose-daily-scrum]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^purpose-sprint-review]: "The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed."[^scrum-guide-2020]

Each [[1.7 Scrum artifacts|Scrum artifact]] has its own [[1.8 commitment|commitment]] to reinforce [[1.3 Scrum theory|Scrum theory]] and the [[1.4 Scrum Values|Scrum Values]][^these-commitments-exist].

[^these-commitments-exist]: "These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders."[^scrum-guide-2020]
