"Commitment" is one of the five [[1.4 Scrum Values|Scrum Values]]. The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] defines a commitment for each of the three [[1.7 Scrum artifacts|Scrum artifacts]][^successful-use][^each-artifact].

| Scrum artifact      | Commitment             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [[Product Backlog]] | [[Product Goal]]       |
| [[Sprint Backlog]]  | [[Sprint Goal]]        |
| [[Increment]]       | [[Definition of Done]] |
[^successful-use]: "Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^each-artifact]: "Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured: For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal. For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal. For the Increment it is the Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]
