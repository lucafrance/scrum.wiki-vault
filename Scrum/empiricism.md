Empiricism is applied when [[Sprint|forecasting]] progress.

[^forecast-empiricism]: "Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Scrum pillars|inspectable]] [[Increment]] at the [[Sprint Review]] support empiricism[^multiple-increments].

[^multiple-increments]: "Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value."[^scrum-guide-2020]
