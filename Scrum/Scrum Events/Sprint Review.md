[^purpose-sprint-review]: "The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^during-the-event]: "During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^sprint-review-second-last]: "The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^for-po-succeed]:"For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^po-accountable-product-backlog]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, \[...\]. The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Sprint Review is timeboxed to four hours maximum for the longest possible [[Sprint]] of one month. For shorter [[Sprint|Sprints]] it should be less[^sprint-review-second-last]. The [[Scrum Master]] ensures that the Sprint Review takes place and stays within the timebox[^scrum-master-events].

[^scrum-master-events]:"The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including: \[...\] Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox."[^scrum-guide-2020]
