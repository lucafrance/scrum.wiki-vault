There are five events in Scrum, which implement the [[Scrum pillars]][^scrum-combines].
- The [[Sprint]] of one month of less, which encompasses all other events[^scrum-combines][^sprints-are-fixed-length].
- The [[Sprint Planning]] at the beginning at the [[Sprint]] to create the [[Sprint Backlog]][^sprint-plan-initiates].
- The [[Daily Scrum]] each workday of the [[Sprint]] to monitor progress towards the [[Sprint Goal]] and adapt the [[Sprint Backlog]][^purpose-daily-scrum][^daily-scrum-is].
- The [[Sprint Review]] for the [[Scrum Team]] and [[stakeholders]] to [[Scrum pillars|inspect]] what was created during the [[Sprint]][^purpose-sprint-review].
- The [[Sprint Retrospective]] for the [[Scrum Team]] to [[Scrum pillars|inspect]] how the [[Sprint]] went and [[Scrum pillars|adapt]] accordingly. The [[Sprint Retrospective]] ends the [[Sprint]][^scrum-team-inspects][^sprint-retrospective-concludes].

[^scrum-combines]: "Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprints-are-fixed-length]: "They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-plan-initiates]: "Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^purpose-daily-scrum]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^daily-scrum-is]: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^purpose-sprint-review]: "The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^scrum-team-inspects]: "The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-retrospective-concludes]: "The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Scrum Events are designed to limit the necessity of other meetings.

The [[Scrum Master]] ensures "that all [[Scrum events]] take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox"[^scrum-guide-2020].

In general, the [[Scrum Guide]] recommends for the [[Scrum events]] to always take place at the same time and place[^optimally-all-events]. For the Daily Scrum specifically this is mandatory[^daily-scrum-15min].


[^optimally-all-events]: "Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^daily-scrum-15min]: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers."[^scrum-guide-2020]
