The [[Scrum Master]] ensures "that all [[Scrum events]] take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox"[^scrum-guide-2020].

In general, the [[Scrum Guide]] recommends for the [[Scrum events]] to always take place at the same time and place[^optimally-all-events]. For the Daily Scrum specifically this is mandatory[^daily-scrum-15min].


[^optimally-all-events]: "Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^daily-scrum-15min]: "The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers."[^scrum-guide-2020]
