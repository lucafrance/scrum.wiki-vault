The [[Sprint]] is the main [[Scrum events|Scrum event]]. All the [[Scrum Team]]'s work happens within the [[Sprint]], including the other [[Scrum events]][^all-work-sprint]. Sprints have a fixed length of one month of less to improve [[Scrum Values|focus and consistency]] of the [[Scrum Team]][^sprint-focus-consistency]. 

[^all-work-sprint]: "The Sprint is a container for all other events." "All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-focus-consistency]:"Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency." "They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency."[^scrum-guide-2020]

There is always an ongoing [[Sprint]]. Every Sprint after the first one starts as soon as the previous Sprint finishes[^sprint-end], and ends with the [[Sprint Retrospective]][^sprint-end]. There is one exception: only the [[Product Owner]] can decide to cancel the [[Sprint]] if the [[Sprint Goal]] becomes obsolete[^sprint-cancelled].

[^sprint-start]: "A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-end]: "The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-cancelled]: "A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

For each [[Sprint]], there can be multiple [[Increment|increments]][^multiple-increments]. The [[Developers]] are [[commitment|committed]] in creating at least one[^developers-definition].

[^multiple-increments]: "Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^developers-definition]: "Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

During the Sprint:
- "Quality does not decrease"[^scrum-guide-2020].
- The [[Sprint Goal]] does not change[^po-devs-changes].
- "No changes are made that would endanger the [[Sprint Goal]]"[^scrum-guide-2020].
- If necessary, the [[Developers]] negotiate the scope of the [[Sprint Backlog]] with the [[Product Owner]][^po-devs-changes].
- If necessary, the [[Product Backlog]] is refined by the [[Product Owner]] or their delegates[^refinement-as-needed][^po-accountable-refinement].

[^po-devs-changes]: "If the work turns out to be different than they expected, \[the Developers\] collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^refinement-as-needed]: During the Sprint: \[...\] The Product Backlog is refined as needed \[...\].
[^po-accountable-refinement]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management \[...\]." "The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others."[^scrum-guide-2020]
## Sprint duration

The [[Scrum Guide]] specifies that each Sprint should last one month of less, but there is no mandated minimum[^scrum-guide-2020].

Shorter Sprints reduce complexity, reduce risk, and allow more chances for [[Scrum pillars|inspection]][^shorter-sprints][^help-inspection]. The Sprint should be long enough for the [[Scrum Team]] to create at least an [[Increment]][^increment-sprint-accountability].

[^help-inspection]:"To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^shorter-sprints]:"Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame."
[^increment-sprint-accountability]: "The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

If the Sprint is too long, the [[Sprint Goal]] is more likely to become obsolete during the Sprint[^sprint-too-long]. If so, that is the only instance where the Sprint can be ended in advance[^sprint-cancelled].

[^sprint-too-long]:"When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase."[^scrum-guide-2020]
