The [[Sprint]] is the main [[Scrum events|Scrum event]].. All the [[Scrum Team]]'s work happens within the [[Sprint]], including the other [[Scrum events]][^all-work-sprint]. Sprints have a fixed length to improve [[Scrum Values|focus and consistency]] of the [[Scrum Team]][^sprint-focus-consistency]. The fixed Sprint length should be of of one month or less[^scrum-guide-2020].

There is always an ongoing [[Sprint]]. Every Sprint after the first one starts as soon as the previous Sprint finishes[^sprint-end], and ends with the [[Sprint Retrospective]][^sprint-end]. There is only one possible exception: only the [[Product Owner]] can decide to cancel the [[Sprint]] if the [[Sprint Goal]] becomes obsolete[^sprint-cancelled].

For each [[Sprint]], there can be multiple [[Increment|increments]][^multiple-increments]. The [[Developers]] are [[commitment|committed]] in creating at least one[^developers-definition].

[^multiple-increments]: "Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^developers-definition]: "Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
