The [[Product Owner]] achieves transparency through the [[Product Backlog]][^scrum-guide-2020].  TODO Questa informazione non è esplicita nella scrum guide, è la mia interpretazione di *Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood*.


> [[Product Backlog item|Product Backlog items]] that can be [[Definition of Done|Done]] by the [[Scrum Team]] within one [[Sprint]] are deemed ready for selection in a [[Sprint Planning]] event. They usually acquire this degree of [[transparency]] after [[Product Backlog refinement|refining]] activities. \[...\]
> [[Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide (2020)]]

Examples of a transparent [[Product Backlog]]:
- an Excel file on a shared folder accessible to the whole [[organization]],
- post-its on a wall in the room where the whole [[organization]] gets their coffee,
- a Jira project set to be visible to everyone in the [[organization]].

Examples of non-transparent [[Product Backlog]] management:
- an Excel file on the desktop of the [[Product Owner]],
- post-its on a wall in a room where only the [[Scrum Team]] works,
- an requirement defined in an email, instead of a [[Product Backlog item]].
