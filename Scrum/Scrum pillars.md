There are three Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, adaptation[^scrum-guide-2020].
The [[Scrum artifacts]] and [[Scrum events]] implement the Scrum pillars[^each-scrum-event][^scrum-artifacts-and-progress].
The [[Scrum artifacts]] are *transparent* to anybody in the [[organization]]. Since they are transparent, they can be *inspected* regularly. The [[Scrum events]] provide the cadence to ensure that the *inspection* takes place. As the [[Scrum artifacts]] are *inspected*, more is learned, enabling *adaptation*. 

[^each-scrum-event]: "Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.
Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^scrum-artifacts-and-progress]: "The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events."[^scrum-guide-2020]
