There are three Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, adaptation[^scrum-guide-2020].

The [[Scrum events]] are functional to the Scrum pillars, as they[^each-scrum-event]:
- are an opportunity to *inspect* and *adapt* the [[Scrum artifacts]],
- enable the required *transparency*.

[^each-scrum-event]: "Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.
Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt."[^scrum-guide-2020]
