> - Creating and clearly communicating [[Product Backlog item|Product Backlog items]];
> - Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
> - Ensuring that the [[Product Backlog]] is [[transparency|transparent, visible and understood]].

> The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.
> 
> For Product Owners to succeed, the entire [[organization]] must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the [[Product Backlog]], and through the inspectable [[Increment]] at the [[Sprint Review]].
> 
> The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many [[stakeholders]] in the [[Product Backlog]]. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.
