# Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is the [[1.8 commitment|commitment]] for the [[4.3 Increment|Increment]][^each-artifact]. A [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog item]] selected for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] becomes an [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] when it meets the Definition of Done[^the-moment-a-pbi].

[^each-artifact]: "Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured: \[...\] For the Increment it is the Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^the-moment-a-pbi]: "The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born."[^scrum-guide-2020]

If available, the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] uses a Definition of Done provided by the [[6.1 organization|organization]]. If not, they define their own Definition of Done[^dod-organization].

[^dod-organization]: "If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] are accountable for adhering to the Definition of Done. When multiple [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] work on the same, they must agree and adhere to the same Definition of Done[^specific-skills-needed][^developers-are-required].

[^specific-skills-needed]: "The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for: \[...\] Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;\[...\]"[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^developers-are-required]: "The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Definition of Done and Nexus

In the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]], the Definition of Done is the commitment for the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] too. The [[N2.1 Nexus Integration Team|Nexus Integration Team]] is responsible for applying the [[5.3 Definition of Done|Definition of Done]] for the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] in the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]] remain responsible for the [[5.3 Definition of Done|Definition of Done]] on their [[4.3 Increment|Increment(s)]][^commitment-ii-is-dod].

[^commitment-ii-is-dod]: "The *commitment* for the Integrated Increment is the **Definition of Done**, which defines the state of the integrated work when it meets the quality and measures required for the product. The Increment is done only when integrated, valuable, and usable. The Nexus Integration Team is responsible for a Definition of Done that can be applied to the Integrated Increment developed each Sprint. All Scrum Teams within the Nexus must define and adhere to this Definition of Done. Individual Scrum Teams self-manage to achieve this state. They may choose to apply a more stringent Definition of Done within their own teams, but cannot apply less rigorous criteria than agreed for the Integrated Increment."[^nexus-guide-2021]
