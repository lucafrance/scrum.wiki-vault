The [[Scrum Team]] is "the fundamental unit of [[Scrum framework|Scrum]]", "a cohesive unit of professionals [[Scrum Values|focused]] on one objective at a time, the [[Product Goal]]"[^scrum-guide-2020]. The Scrum Team is "structured [...] by the [[organization]]"[^scrum-guide-2020] and consists of one [[Product Owner]], one [[Scrum Master]], multiple [[Developers]][^scrum-team-definition].

[^scrum-team-definition]: "The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Scrum Team]] is accountable for creating at least one [[Increment]] for each [[Sprint]][^increment-sprint-accountability]. The [[Scrum Team]] is responsible for all product-related activities[^scrum-team-responsibility].

[^increment-sprint-accountability]: "The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^scrum-team-responsibility]: "The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Scrum Team]] is[^scrum-guide-2020]:
- cross-functional: "the members have all the skills necessary to create value each [[Sprint]]";
- self-managing: "they internally decide who does what, when, and how";
- without "sub-teams or hierarchies".
The "self-managing" part is empowered by the [[organization]][^organization-empowers-scrum-team].

[^organization-empowers-scrum-team]: "They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work."

The Scrum Team works in [[Sprint|Sprints]] "at a sustainable pace" to improve its "[[Scrum Values|focus and consistency]]"[^scrum-guide-2020].
## Scrum Team size

The [[Scrum Guide]] recommends small Scrum Team sizes of 10 people or less for better communication and productivity[^small-scrum-teams]. The Scrum Team should also be large enough "complete significant work within a [[Sprint]]", as it is still accountable for creating an [[Increment]][^scrum-guide-2020].

If the Scrum Team becomes to large, it can be split in multiple Teams working on the same product. If so, all Scrum Teams should still share the same [[Product Goal]], [[Product Backlog]], [[Product Owner]][^multiple-scrum-teams]. There is a scaled version of [[Scrum framework|Scrum]] with such a structure called [Nexus](https://www.scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide).

[^small-scrum-teams]: "The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team." "The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^multiple-scrum-teams]: "If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner."[^scrum-guide-2020]
## The Scrum Master and the Scrum Team

Within the [[Scrum Team]], the [[Scrum Master]] is accountable for establishing [[Scrum framework|Scrum]] as defined in the [[Scrum Guide]] and for the teams' effectiveness. They help the [[Scrum Team]] improve its practices withing the [[Scrum framework]][^scrum-master-team-accountable].

[^scrum-master-team-accountable]: "The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide." "The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Teamâ€™s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework."[^scrum-guide-2020]
