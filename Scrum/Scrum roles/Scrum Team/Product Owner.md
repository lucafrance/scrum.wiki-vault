The Product Owner is a member of the [[Scrum Team]], who is accountable for maximizing the value of the product[^scrum-guide-2020].

There is one Product Owner in the Scrum Team[^scrum-team-definition]. The Product Owner is always a single person[^po-not-a-committee]. Multiple Scrum Teams can share the same Product Owner, but there is always a single Product Owner for each product[^one-po-product-baklog].

The Product Owner is also accountable for managing the [[Product Backlog]]. They Product Owner may delegate the responsibilities related to the Product Backlog, but remains accountable for them[^scrum-guide-2020].

The Product Backlog management responsibilities include[^scrum-guide-2020]:
- Developing and communicating the [[Product Goal]] (the [[commitment]] of the Product Backlog);
- Creating and managing the [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]];
- Ensuring [[transparency]] for the [[Product Backlog]][^transparency-product-backlog].

The Product Owner ensures transparency for the [[Product Backlog]] by also making it visible to the whole [[organization]][^po-decisions].

[^po-not-a-committee]:: "The Product Owner is one person, not a committee."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^transparency-product-backlog]: "Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood."[^scrum-guide-2020]
