The Product Owner is a member of the [[Scrum Team]], who is accountable for maximizing the value of the product[^scrum-guide-2020].

The Product Owner is always a single person in the Scrum Team[^scrum-team-definition][^po-not-a-committee]. Multiple Scrum Teams can share the same Product Owner, but there is always a single Product Owner for each product[^one-po-product-baklog].

The Product Owner is also accountable for managing the [[Product Backlog]]. They Product Owner may delegate the responsibilities related to the Product Backlog, but remains accountable for them[^scrum-guide-2020].

The Product Backlog management responsibilities include[^scrum-guide-2020]:
- Developing and communicating the [[Product Goal]] (the [[commitment]] of the Product Backlog);
- Creating and managing the [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]];
- Ensuring [[transparency]] for the [[Product Backlog]][^transparency-product-backlog].

The Product Owner ensures transparency for the [[Product Backlog]] by also making it visible to the whole [[organization]][^po-decisions].

During the [[Sprint Planning]], the [[Developers]] decide which [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] go in the [[Sprint Backlog]], but the [[Product Owner]] may influence them " by helping them understand and select trade-offs"[^scrum-guide-2020]. TODO misleading

[^scrum-team-definition]: "The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^one-po-product-baklog]: "If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^po-not-a-committee]: "The Product Owner is one person, not a committee."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^transparency-product-backlog]: "Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^po-decisions]: "The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work." "For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review."[^scrum-guide-2020] The [[Scrum Guide]] considers a visible Product Backlog as a given.
