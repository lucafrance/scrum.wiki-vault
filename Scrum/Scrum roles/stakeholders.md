"The [[Product Owner]] may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the [[Product Backlog]]." If a stakeholder wants to update the Product Backlog, they need to convince the Product Owner[^scrum-guide-2020].

The [[Scrum Master]] facilitates "[[stakeholders|stakeholder]] collaboration as requested or needed"[^scrum-guide-2020].


> The [[Scrum Master]] serves the [[organization]] in several ways, including:
> - Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
> - Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
> - Helping employees and [[stakeholders]] understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
> - Removing barriers between [[stakeholders]] and [[Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]].
