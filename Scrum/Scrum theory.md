## Empiricism

Empiricism is applied when [[Sprint|forecasting]] progress.

[^forecast-empiricism]: "Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Scrum theory|inspectable]] [[Increment]] at the [[Sprint Review]] support empiricism[^multiple-increments].

[^multiple-increments]: "Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Scrum pillars

There are three Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, adaptation[^scrum-guide-2020].
The [[Scrum artifacts]] and [[Scrum events]] implement the Scrum pillars[^each-scrum-event][^scrum-artifacts-and-progress].
The [[Scrum artifacts]] are *transparent* to anybody in the [[organization]]. Since they are transparent, they can be *inspected* regularly. The [[Scrum events]] provide the cadence to ensure that the *inspection* takes place. As the [[Scrum artifacts]] are *inspected*, more is learned, enabling *adaptation*. 

[^each-scrum-event]: "Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.
Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^scrum-artifacts-and-progress]: "The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events."[^scrum-guide-2020]
