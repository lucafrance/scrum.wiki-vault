From the [[Scrum Guide]].
> Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:
> **_Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage_**
> 
> The [[Scrum Team]] commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The [[Scrum Team]] and its [[stakeholders]] are open about the work and the challenges. [[Scrum Team]] members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The [[Scrum Team]] members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
> 
> These values give direction to the [[Scrum Team]] with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The [[Scrum Team]] members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical [[Scrum pillars]] of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.

The Scrum Values are reflected in the [[Scrum Guide]], e.g.:
- The [[Scrum Team]] "is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal".
- "\[The [[Developers]] hold\] each other accountable as professionals".
- "[[Scrum Master|Scrum Masters]] are true leaders who serve the [[Scrum Team]] and the larger [[organization]]."
