The Sprint Backlog is the [[Developers]]' plan for the [[Sprint]]. It has three components[^sprint-backlog-is-composed][^sprint-backlog-is-a-plan]
1. the [[Sprint Goal]],
2. the [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] selected for the [[Sprint]],
3. a plan on how to deliver the [[Increment]].

[^sprint-backlog-is-composed]: "The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-backlog-is-a-plan]: The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Scrum Team]] creates the Sprint Backlog during the [[Sprint Planning]][^sprint-plan-initiates]. The [[Developers]] are accountable for its creation[^devs-accountable]. The Sprint Backlog may include improvements identified in the previous [[Sprint Retrospective]].

[^sprint-plan-initiates]:"Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^devs-accountable]: "The Developers are always accountable for: \[...\] Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\[...\] "[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^the-scrum-team-identifies]: "The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the [[Sprint]] as work progresses and more is learned[^sprint-backlog-is-a-plan].

The [[Developers]] inspect the progress toward the [[Sprint Goal]] every workday at the [[Daily Scrum]][^sprint-goal-daily-scrum]. They can [[Scrum pillars|adapt]] the [[Sprint Backlog]] accordingly throughout the day as necessary[^backlog-update-multiple-times]. The scope of the [[Sprint Backlog]] can be negotiated by the Developers with the [[Product Owner]] as long as the [[Sprint Goal]] stays unaffected[^negotiate-scope-po].

[^sprint-goal-daily-scrum]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team."^[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^backlog-update-multiple-times]: "The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^negotiate-scope-po]: "\[...\]If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]
