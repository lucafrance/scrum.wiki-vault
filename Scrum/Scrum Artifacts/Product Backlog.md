The Product Backlog is an "emergent, ordered" list of Product Backlog items that are "needed to improve the product"[^scrum-guide-2020]. The [[Product Owner]] is accountable for managing the Product Backlog, but they can delegate the responsibilities[^po-responsible-backlog].

[^po-responsible-backlog]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management \[...\]." "The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Product Backlog is the "single source of work undertaken by the [[Scrum Team]]"[^scrum-guide-2020]. The [[Product Owner]] ensures that the most important Product Backlog items are ready to be discussed at the [[Sprint Planning]][^po-pbi-ready].

[^po-pbi-ready]:"The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Product Backlog items ready which can be [[Definition of Done|done]] within a [[Sprint]] are considered by the [[Scrum Team]] during the [[Sprint Planning]]. Items that cannot be [[Definition of Done|done]] in one [[Sprint]] need to be refined to be considered in the next [[Sprint Planning]]. The items selected for the [[Sprint]] leave the Product Backlog and enter the [[Sprint Backlog]].[^pbi-planning]

[^pbi-planning]:"Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event." "The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Product Backlog refinement

The Product Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity. It is not a [[Scrum events|Scrum event]]. Three things can be done during the refinement[^refinement-definition].
1. The order of items is updated. Remember from the definition of the [[Product Backlog]] that it is an *ordered* list.
2. Bigger items are broken down into smaller items.
3. Details are added to the items, e.g. description and size. The kind of details that should be added depends on the domain of work.

[^refinement-definition]: "Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The refinement does not necessarily have a fixed cadence, it is just done as needed during the [[Sprint]][^refinement-as-needed].

[^refinement-as-needed]: During the Sprint: \[...\] The Product Backlog is refined as needed \[...\].

The [[Product Owner]] is accountable for the refinement, as they are accountable for managing the Product Backlog in general, but they can still delegate the responsibility[^po-accountable-refinement].
Through the refinement, the Product Backlog items become more transparent[^refinement-transparency].

[^po-accountable-refinement]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management \[...\]." "The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^refinement-transparency]: "Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities."[^scrum-guide-2020]
## Product Backlog Items sizing

The [[Developers]] are responsible for sizing the [[Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]], which is functional to understanding which ones can be [[Definition of Done|done]] within a [[Sprint]][^developers-sizing]. Item sizing is part of the Product Backlog refinement activity (see previous section).

[^developers-sizing]:"\[The Product Backlog\] is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team." "The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[Scrum Guide]] does not mandate any particular sizing technique[^scrum-guide-2020].
