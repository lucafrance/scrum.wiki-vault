From the [[Scrum Guide]]
> Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum is a framework for a [[Scrum Team]] to generate value iteratively within an [[organization]]. Scrum is designed to increase value while minimizing risk. This is achieved through [[Scrum theory|empiricism]] to learn from experience and [[Scrum theory|lean thinking]] to minimize waste. 
Empiricism is supported by the [[Scrum theory|Scrum pillars]], which are implemented by the [[Scrum events]] and [[Scrum artifacts]]. The [[Scrum Team]] and the [[organization]] must live the [[Scrum Values]] for Scrum to be effective.
