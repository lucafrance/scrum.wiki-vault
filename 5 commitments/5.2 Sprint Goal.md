The Sprint Goal is the [[1.8 commitment|commitment]] for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] defines the Sprint Goal at the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]]. The Sprint Goal communicates to the [[6.2 stakeholders|stakeholders]] why the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] is valuable[^each-artifact][^po-proposes].

[^each-artifact]: "Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured: \[...\] For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^po-proposes]: "The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Sprint Goal does not change during the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. If the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, then the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] can be cancelled by the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]]. This is the only instance where the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] can end in advance[^sprint-goal-is-created][^sprint-could-be-cancelled].

[^sprint-goal-is-created]: "The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^sprint-could-be-cancelled]:"A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] are accountable for inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal daily in the [[3.3 Daily Scrum|Daily Scrum]] and [[1.3 Scrum theory|adapting]] the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] accordingly[^devs-accountable][^sprint-goal-daily-scrum].

[^devs-accountable]: "The Developers are always accountable for: \[...\] adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal;\[...\] "[^scrum-guide-2020]

[^sprint-goal-daily-scrum]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team."^[^scrum-guide-2020]
