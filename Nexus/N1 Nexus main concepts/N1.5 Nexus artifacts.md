# Nexus artifacts

The [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]] adds two artifacts[^nexus-guide-2021]:
- [[N4.1 Nexus Sprint Backlog|Nexus Sprint Backlog]],
- [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]].

The [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] remains one for the whole [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] retain their own [[1.7 Scrum artifacts|Scrum artifacts]][^nexus-guide-2021]:
- [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]],
- [[4.3 Increment|Increment(s)]].

Like the [[1.7 Scrum artifacts|Scrum artifacts]], the Nexus artifacts[^scrum-artifacts-represent][^artifacts-represent][^nexus-extends-scrum]:
- represent work or value,
- are designed to maximize [[1.3 Scrum theory|transparency]]
- contain a [[1.8 commitment|commitment]].

[^artifacts-represent]: "Artifacts represent work or value, and are designed to maximize transparency, as described in the Scrum Guide. The Nexus Integration Team works with the Scrum Teams within a Nexus to ensure that transparency is achieved across all artifacts and that the state of the Integrated Increment is widely understood."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-extends-scrum]: "Nexus extends Scrum with the following artifacts, and each artifact contains a commitment, as indicated below. These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum value for the Nexus and its stakeholders."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-guide-2021]: [[N1.2 Nexus Guide|Nexus Guide (2021)]]

[^scrum-artifacts-represent]: "Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation."[^scrum-guide-2020]
