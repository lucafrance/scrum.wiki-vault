From the [[N1.2 Nexus Guide|Nexus Guide (2021)]].

> Nexus builds upon Scrum by enhancing the foundational elements of Scrum in ways that help solve the dependency and collaboration challenges of cross-team work. Nexus (see Figure 1) reveals an empirical process that closely mirrors Scrum.
> 
> Nexus extends Scrum in the following ways:
> - **Accountabilities**: The [[N2.1 Nexus Integration Team|Nexus Integration Team]] ensures that the Nexus delivers a valuable, useful [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] at least once every [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The [[N2.1 Nexus Integration Team|Nexus Integration Team]] consists of the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]], a [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]], and Nexus Integration Team Members.
> - **Events**: [[1.6 Scrum events|Events]] are appended to, placed around, or replace regular Scrum events to augment them. As modified, they serve both the overall effort of all [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] in the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]], and each individual team. A [[N5.1 Nexus Sprint Goal|Nexus Sprint Goal]] is the objective for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]].
> - **Artifacts**: All Scrum Teams use the same, single [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]]. As the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] are refined and made ready, indicators of which team will most likely do the work inside a [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] are made transparent. A [[N4.1 Nexus Sprint Backlog|Nexus Sprint Backlog]] exists to assist with transparency during the Sprint. The [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] represents the current sum of all integrated work completed by a [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]].
