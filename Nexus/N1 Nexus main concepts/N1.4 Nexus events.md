[^adds-or-extends]: "Nexus adds to or extends the events defined by Scrum. The duration of Nexus events is guided by the length of the corresponding events in the Scrum Guide. They are timeboxed in addition to their corresponding Scrum events."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^at-scale]: "At scale, it may not be practical for all members of the Nexus to participate to share information or to come to an agreement. Except where noted, Nexus events are attended by whichever members of the Nexus are needed to achieve the intended outcome of the event most effectively."[^nexus-guide-2021]
