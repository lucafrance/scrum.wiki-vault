The Nexus Integration Team (NIT) is an addition of the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]] to [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]][^nexus-accountability]. It is composed of the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]], a [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] and one or more appropriate members from the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]][^nexus-members]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] members of the NIT can change over time depending on the needs of the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]][^nexus-members]. In case of conflict, each NIT member prioritises the work for the Nexus over the one for their [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]][^membership-precedence].

The NIT is accountable for creating at least one [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] for [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]][^nit-is-accountable]. From [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]], the individual [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] are already accountable for creating at least one [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] per [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]][^increment-sprint-accountability]. The NIT enables the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] to [[1.4 Scrum Values|focus]] on their [[4.3 Increment|Increments]], while the NIT concentrates on the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]][^nit-focus-integration].

The NIT minimizes and addresses cross-team issues and dependencies which can hinder the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]][^nit-focus-integration]. The NIT is also responsible in supporting guiding the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] to create their increment[^nit-coaching].

> The NIT only provides guidance for the integration of the [[4.3 Increment|Increments]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] are the ones doing the integration.

[^nexus-accountability]: "A Nexus consists of Scrum Teams that work together toward a Product Goal. The Scrum framework defines three specific sets of accountabilities within a Scrum Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master. These accountabilities are prescribed in the Scrum Guide. In Nexus, an additional accountability is introduced, the Nexus Integration Team."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nit-is-accountable]: "The Nexus Integration Team is accountable for ensuring that a done Integrated Increment (the combined work completed by a Nexus) is produced at least once a Sprint. It provides the focus that makes possible the accountability of multiple Scrum Teams to come together to create valuable, useful Increments, as prescribed in Scrum."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nit-focus-integration]: "While Scrum Teams address integration issues within the Nexus, the Nexus Integration Team provides a focal point of integration for the Nexus. Integration includes addressing technical and non-technical cross-functional team constraints that may impede a Nexusâ€™ ability to deliver a constantly Integrated Increment. It should use bottom-up intelligence from within the Nexus to achieve resolution."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-members]: "The Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and the appropriate members from the Scrum Teams belong to the Nexus Integration Team. Appropriate members are the people with the necessary skills and knowledge to help resolve the issues the Nexus faces at any point in time. Composition of the Nexus Integration Team may change over time to reflect the current needs of a Nexus. Common activities the Nexus Integration Team might perform include coaching, consulting, and highlighting awareness of dependencies and cross-team issues."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nit-coaching]: "The Nexus Integration Team is responsible for coaching and guiding the Scrum Teams to acquire, implement, and learn practices and tools that improve their ability to produce a valuable, useful Increment."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^membership-precedence]: "Membership in the Nexus Integration Team takes precedence over individual Scrum Team membership. As long as their Nexus Integration Team responsibility is satisfied, they can work as team members of their respective Scrum Teams. This preference helps ensure that the work to resolve issues affecting multiple teams has priority."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^increment-sprint-accountability]: "The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]
