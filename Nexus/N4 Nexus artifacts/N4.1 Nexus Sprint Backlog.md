[^result-nexus-sprint-planning]: "The result of Nexus Sprint Planning is:
    - a Nexus Sprint Goal that aligns with the Product Goal and describes the purpose that will be achieved by the Nexus during the Sprint
    - a Sprint Goal for each Scrum Team that aligns with the Nexus Sprint Goal
    - a single Nexus Sprint Backlog that represents the work of the Nexus toward the Nexus Sprint Goal and makes cross-team dependencies transparent
    - A Sprint Backlog for each Scrum Team, which makes transparent the work they will do in support of the Nexus Sprint Goal"[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-sprint-backlog]: "A Nexus Sprint Backlog is the composite of the Nexus Sprint Goal and Product Backlog items from the Sprint Backlogs of the individual Scrum Teams. It is used to highlight dependencies and the flow of work during the Sprint. The Nexus Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that the Nexus can inspect their progress in the Nexus Daily Scrum."[^nexus-sprint-backlog]
