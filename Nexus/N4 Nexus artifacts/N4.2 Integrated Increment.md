The Integrated Increment is the combination of all [[4.3 Increment|Increments]] from the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] in a [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]][^nit-is-accountable]. The NIT is accountable for creating at least one [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] for [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]][^nit-is-accountable].

The Increment is presented at the [[N3.4 Nexus Sprint Review|Nexus Sprint Review]] to the participating [[6.2 stakeholders|stakeholders]], but it can be delivered before[^represents-current-sum][^nexus-review-end-of-sprint][^since-entire-integrated].

[^nit-is-accountable]: "The Nexus Integration Team is accountable for ensuring that a done Integrated Increment (the combined work completed by a Nexus) is produced at least once a Sprint. It provides the focus that makes possible the accountability of multiple Scrum Teams to come together to create valuable, useful Increments, as prescribed in Scrum."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-review-end-of-sprint]: "The Nexus Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to provide feedback on the done Integrated Increment that the Nexus has built over the Sprint and determine future adaptations."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^since-entire-integrated]: "Since the entire Integrated Increment is the focus for capturing feedback from stakeholders, a Nexus Sprint Review replaces individual Scrum Team Sprint Reviews. During the event, the Nexus presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed, although it may not be possible to show all completed work in detail. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what the Nexus should do to address the feedback. The Product Backlog may be adjusted to reflect these discussions."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^represents-current-sum]: "The Integrated Increment represents the current sum of all integrated work completed by a Nexus toward the Product Goal. The Integrated Increment is inspected at the Nexus Sprint Review, but may be delivered to stakeholders before the end of the Sprint. The Integrated Increment must meet the Definition of Done."[^nexus-guide-2021]
