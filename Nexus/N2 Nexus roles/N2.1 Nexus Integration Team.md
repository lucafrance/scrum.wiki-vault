The Nexus Integration Team (NIT) is an addition of the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]] to [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]]. It is composed of the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]], a [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] and one or more appropriate members from the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] members of the NIT can change over time depending on the needs of the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]]. In case of conflict, each NIT member prioritises the work for the Nexus over the one for their [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]].

The NIT is accountable for creating at least one [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]] for [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. From [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]], the individual [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] are already accountable for creating at least one [[4.3 Increment|Increment]] per [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The NIT enables the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] to [[1.4 Scrum Values|focus]] on their [[4.3 Increment|Increments]], while the NIT concentrates on the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]].

The NIT minimizes and addresses cross-team issues and dependencies which can hinder the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]]. The NIT does not only work on the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]], it is also responsible in supporting guiding the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] to create their increment.

> [!note]
> The NIT only provides guidance for the individual [[4.3 Increment|Increments]]. The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] are still the ones creating it.
