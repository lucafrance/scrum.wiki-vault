The Nexus Daily Scrum is a [[N1.5 Nexus Events|Nexus event]] which takes place before [[3.3 Daily Scrum|Daily Scrums]] of the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]]. The attendees are representatives from each [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] who[^purpose-nexus-daily]:
- inspect progress towards the [[N5.1 Nexus Sprint Goal|Nexus Sprint Goal]],
- identify issues to merge the [[4.3 Increment|Increments]] into the [[N4.2 Integrated Increment|Integrated Increment]],
- identify new cross-team dependencies.

The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] meet afterwards for their [[3.3 Daily Scrum|Daily Scrums]] and:
- inspect progress towards the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] as defined for [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]][^purpose-of-daily],

Cross-team communication can continue throughout the day as needed. It is not limited to the Nexus daily scrum[^nexus-daily-not-only].

[^purpose-nexus-daily]: "The purpose of the Nexus Daily Scrum is to identify any integration issues and inspect progress toward the Nexus Sprint Goal. Appropriate representatives from the Scrum Teams attend the Nexus Daily Scrum, inspect the current state of the integrated Increment, and identify integration issues and newly discovered cross-team dependencies or impacts. Each Scrum Team’s Daily Scrum complements the Nexus Daily Scrum by creating plans for the day, focused primarily on addressing the integration issues raised during the Nexus Daily Scrum."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-daily-not-only]: "The Nexus Daily Scrum is not the only time Scrum Teams in the Nexus are allowed to adjust their plan. Cross-team communication can occur throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^purpose-of-daily]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work."[^scrum-guide-2020]
