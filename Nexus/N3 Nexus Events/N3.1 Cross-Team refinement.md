The Cross-Team Refinement is an ongoing [[N1.5 Nexus events|Nexus event]] to refine cross-team dependencies in the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]]. The [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] are decomposed such that[^reduces-eliminates-dependencies][^serves-dual-purpose]:
- the dependencies are [[1.3 Scrum theory|transparent]],
- it is possible to forecast which [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] will deliver which item.

The frequency, duration, and attendance of the Cross-Team refinement varies as needed[^is-ongoing].

The [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog refinement]] from [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]] continues for the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]][^where-needed].

A refined [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] is functional to identify the dependencies before the [[N3.2 Nexus Sprint Planning|Nexus Sprint Planning]][^where-needed].

[^reduces-eliminates-dependencies]: "Cross-Team Refinement of the Product Backlog reduces or eliminates cross-team dependencies within a Nexus. The Product Backlog must be decomposed so that dependencies are transparent, identified across teams, and removed or minimized. Product Backlog items pass through different levels of decomposition from very large and vague requests to actionable work that a single Scrum Team could deliver inside a Sprint."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^serves-dual-purpose]: "Cross-Team Refinement of the Product Backlog at scale serves a dual purpose:
    - It helps the Scrum Teams forecast which team will deliver which Product Backlog items.
    - It identifies dependencies across those teams."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^is-ongoing]: "Cross-Team Refinement is ongoing. The frequency, duration, and attendance of Cross-Team Refinement varies to optimize these two purposes."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^where-needed]: "Where needed, each Scrum Team will continue their own refinement in order for the Product Backlog items to be ready for selection in a Nexus Sprint Planning event. An adequately refined Product Backlog will minimize the emergence of new dependencies during Nexus Sprint Planning."[^nexus-guide-2021]
