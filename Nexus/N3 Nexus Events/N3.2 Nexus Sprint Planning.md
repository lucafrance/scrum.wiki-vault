The Nexus Sprint Planning is a [[N1.5 Nexus events|Nexus event]] extending the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]] of the individual [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]][^adds-extends-events].

The [[N3.1 Cross-Team refinement|Cross-Team refinements]] and [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog refinements]] should take place as needed before the [[N3.2 Nexus Sprint Planning|Nexus Sprint Planning]] to minime new dependencies emerging during the Nexus Sprint Planning[^where-needed].

The result of the Nexus Sprint Planning is[^result-nexus-sprint-planning]:
- a [[N5.1 Nexus Sprint Goal|Nexus Sprint Goal]], the commitment for the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]] for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]],
- a [[N4.1 Nexus Sprint Backlog|Nexus Sprint Backlog]] with:
	- the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] included in all of the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]]' [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlogs]],
	- transparent cross-teams dependencies,
- a [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] with a [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] for each [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] (same as [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]]'s [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]]).

The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]]' [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goals]] are no longer aligned with the [[5.1 Product Goal|Product Goal]] directly, but with the [[N5.1 Nexus Sprint Goal|Nexus Sprint Goal]]. The [[N5.1 Nexus Sprint Goal|Nexus Sprint Goal]] is aligned with the [[5.1 Product Goal|Product Goal]][^result-nexus-sprint-planning].

The whole [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]] does not need to participate to the Sprint Planning, just the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] and representatives for each [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] as necessary[^at-scale][^purpose-nexus-sprint-planning].

[^adds-extends-events]: "Nexus adds to or extends the events defined by Scrum. The duration of Nexus events is guided by the length of the corresponding events in the Scrum Guide. They are timeboxed in addition to their corresponding Scrum events."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^where-needed]: "Where needed, each Scrum Team will continue their own refinement in order for the Product Backlog items to be ready for selection in a Nexus Sprint Planning event. An adequately refined Product Backlog will minimize the emergence of new dependencies during Nexus Sprint Planning."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^at-scale]: "At scale, it may not be practical for all members of the Nexus to participate to share information or to come to an agreement. Except where noted, Nexus events are attended by whichever members of the Nexus are needed to achieve the intended outcome of the event most effectively."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^purpose-nexus-sprint-planning]: "The purpose of Nexus Sprint Planning is to coordinate the activities of all Scrum Teams within a Nexus for a single Sprint. Appropriate representatives from each Scrum Team and the Product Owner meet to plan the Sprint."[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^result-nexus-sprint-planning]: "The result of Nexus Sprint Planning is:
    - a Nexus Sprint Goal that aligns with the Product Goal and describes the purpose that will be achieved by the Nexus during the Sprint
    - a Sprint Goal for each Scrum Team that aligns with the Nexus Sprint Goal
    - a single Nexus Sprint Backlog that represents the work of the Nexus toward the Nexus Sprint Goal and makes cross-team dependencies transparent
    - A Sprint Backlog for each Scrum Team, which makes transparent the work they will do in support of the Nexus Sprint Goal"[^nexus-guide-2021]
