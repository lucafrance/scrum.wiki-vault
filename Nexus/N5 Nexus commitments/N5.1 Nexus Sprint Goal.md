The Nexus Sprint Goal is the [[1.8 commitment|commitment]] of the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]] for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. The [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus]] defines the Nexus Sprint Goal at the [[N3.2 Nexus Sprint Planning|Nexus Sprint Planning]]. The Nexus Sprint Goal communicates to the [[6.2 stakeholders|stakeholders]] why the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] is valuable[^is-the-nexus-sprint-goal][^result-nexus-sprint-planning].

The Nexus Sprint Goal is aligned with the [[5.1 Product Goal|Product Goal]]. The [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goals]] of the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]] are aligned with the Nexus Sprint Goal[^result-nexus-sprint-planning].

[^result-nexus-sprint-planning]: "The result of Nexus Sprint Planning is:
    - a Nexus Sprint Goal that aligns with the Product Goal and describes the purpose that will be achieved by the Nexus during the Sprint
    - a Sprint Goal for each Scrum Team that aligns with the Nexus Sprint Goal
    - a single Nexus Sprint Backlog that represents the work of the Nexus toward the Nexus Sprint Goal and makes cross-team dependencies transparent
    - A Sprint Backlog for each Scrum Team, which makes transparent the work they will do in support of the Nexus Sprint Goal"[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^is-the-nexus-sprint-goal]: "The *commitment* for the Nexus Sprint Backlog is the **Nexus Sprint Goal**. The Nexus Sprint Goal is a single objective for the Nexus. It is the sum of all the work and Sprint Goals of the Scrum Teams within the Nexus. It creates coherence and focus for the Nexus for the Sprint by encouraging the Scrum Teams to work together rather than on separate initiatives. The Nexus Sprint Goal is created at the Nexus Sprint Planning event and added to the Nexus Sprint Backlog. As Scrum Teams work during the Sprint, they keep the Nexus Sprint Goal in mind. The Nexus should demonstrate the valuable and useful functionality that is done to achieve the Nexus Sprint Goal at the Nexus Sprint Review in order to receive stakeholder feedback."[^is-the-nexus-sprint-goal]
