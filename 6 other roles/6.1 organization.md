- Its standards define the minimum [[5.3 Definition of Done|Definition of Done]][^dod-organization].

[^the-scrum-team]: "The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Teamâ€™s focus and consistency."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^product-owner-decisions]:""For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^dod-organization]: "If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[2.3 Scrum Master|Scrum Master]] is accountable for establishing [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]] in the organization as defined by the [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]].
