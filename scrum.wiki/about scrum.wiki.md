This wiki was written in 2025 based mostly on the [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide (2020)]] and the [[N1.2 Nexus Guide|Nexus Guide (2021)]]. It is designed to be a quick reference for all relevant [[1.1 Scrum framework|Scrum]] topics and how they relate to each other.

The wiki is available as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)  vault to download on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucafrance/scrum.wiki-vault).

## Style guide
The capitalisation of Scrum terminology is consistent with the Scrum Guide if mentioned there. E.g.: *Product Owner* is capitalised, *transparency* is not.

Each statement has source. Non-obvious interpretations of the Scrum Guide without a source are not included.
