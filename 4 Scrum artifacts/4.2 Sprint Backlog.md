The Sprint Backlog is the [[2.1 Developers|Developers]]' plan for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]]. It has three components[^sprint-backlog-is-composed][^sprint-backlog-is-a-plan]
1. the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]],
2. the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] selected for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]],
3. a plan on how to deliver the [[4.3 Increment|Increment]].

[^sprint-backlog-is-composed]: "The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^sprint-backlog-is-a-plan]: The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] creates the Sprint Backlog during the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]][^sprint-plan-initiates]. The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] are accountable for its creation[^devs-accountable]. The Sprint Backlog may include improvements identified in the previous [[3.5 Sprint Retrospective|Sprint Retrospective]].

[^sprint-plan-initiates]:"Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^devs-accountable]: "The Developers are always accountable for: \[...\] Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;\[...\] "[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^the-scrum-team-identifies]: "The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] as work progresses and more is learned[^sprint-backlog-is-a-plan].

The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] inspect the progress toward the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] every workday at the [[3.3 Daily Scrum|Daily Scrum]][^sprint-goal-daily-scrum]. They can [[1.3 Scrum theory|adapt]] the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] accordingly throughout the day as necessary[^backlog-update-multiple-times]. The scope of the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] can be negotiated by the Developers with the [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] as long as the [[5.2 Sprint Goal|Sprint Goal]] stays unaffected[^negotiate-scope-po].

[^sprint-goal-daily-scrum]: "The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team."^[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^backlog-update-multiple-times]: "The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^negotiate-scope-po]: "\[...\]If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Sprint Backlog and Nexus

In the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]], the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]] in the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlogs]] of each [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] are also part of the [[N4.1 Nexus Sprint Backlog|Nexus Sprint Backlog]][^result-nexus-sprint-planning][^nexus-sprint-backlog].

[^result-nexus-sprint-planning]: "The result of Nexus Sprint Planning is:
    - a Nexus Sprint Goal that aligns with the Product Goal and describes the purpose that will be achieved by the Nexus during the Sprint
    - a Sprint Goal for each Scrum Team that aligns with the Nexus Sprint Goal
    - a single Nexus Sprint Backlog that represents the work of the Nexus toward the Nexus Sprint Goal and makes cross-team dependencies transparent
    - A Sprint Backlog for each Scrum Team, which makes transparent the work they will do in support of the Nexus Sprint Goal"[^nexus-guide-2021]

[^nexus-sprint-backlog]: "A Nexus Sprint Backlog is the composite of the Nexus Sprint Goal and Product Backlog items from the Sprint Backlogs of the individual Scrum Teams. It is used to highlight dependencies and the flow of work during the Sprint. The Nexus Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that the Nexus can inspect their progress in the Nexus Daily Scrum."[^nexus-sprint-backlog]
