The Product Backlog is an "emergent, ordered" list of Product Backlog items that are "needed to improve the product"[^scrum-guide-2020]. The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] is accountable for managing the Product Backlog, but they can delegate the responsibilities[^po-responsible-backlog].

[^po-responsible-backlog]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management \[...\]." "The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Product Backlog is the "single source of work undertaken by the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]]"[^scrum-guide-2020]. The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] ensures that the most important Product Backlog items are ready to be discussed at the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]][^po-pbi-ready].

[^po-pbi-ready]:"The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The Product Backlog items which can be [[5.3 Definition of Done|done]] within a [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] are considered by the [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] during the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]]. Items that cannot be [[5.3 Definition of Done|done]] in one [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] need to be refined to be considered in the next [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]]. The items selected for the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]] are added to the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]].[^pbi-planning]

[^pbi-planning]:"Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event." "The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)."[^scrum-guide-2020]

It is up to the [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] to decide how to turn the Product Backlog items in the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]] to a valuable [[4.3 Increment|Increment]]. They might choose to decompose the items into smaller ones which can be completed in a day or less[^items-decomposing].

[^items-decomposing]: "For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value."[^scrum-guide-2020]

## Product Backlog refinement

The Product Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity. It is not a [[1.6 Scrum events|Scrum event]]. Three things can be done during the refinement[^refinement-definition].
1. The order of items is updated. Remember from the definition of the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] that it is an *ordered* list.
2. Bigger items are broken down into smaller items.
3. Details are added to the items, e.g. description and size. The kind of details that should be added depends on the domain of work.

[^refinement-definition]: "Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The refinement does not necessarily have a fixed cadence, it is just done as needed during the [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]][^refinement-as-needed].

[^refinement-as-needed]: During the Sprint: \[...\] The Product Backlog is refined as needed \[...\].

The [[2.2 Product Owner|Product Owner]] is accountable for the refinement, as they are accountable for managing the Product Backlog in general, but they can still delegate the responsibility[^po-accountable-refinement].
Through the refinement, the Product Backlog items become more transparent[^refinement-transparency].

[^po-accountable-refinement]: "The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management \[...\]." "The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable."[^scrum-guide-2020]
[^refinement-transparency]: "Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Team]] may refine the Product Backlog during the [[3.2 Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]] when selecting the Product Backlog items to add to the [[4.2 Sprint Backlog|Sprint Backlog]][^refinement-sprint-plan].

[^refinement-sprint-plan]: "Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence."[^scrum-guide-2020]
## Product Backlog Items sizing

The [[2.1 Developers|Developers]] are responsible for sizing the [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog items]], which is functional to understanding which ones can be [[5.3 Definition of Done|done]] within a [[3.1 Sprint|Sprint]][^developers-sizing]. Item sizing is part of the Product Backlog refinement activity (see previous section).

[^developers-sizing]:"\[The Product Backlog\] is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team." "The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing."[^scrum-guide-2020]

The [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide]] does not mandate any particular sizing technique[^scrum-guide-2020].

[^scrum-guide-2020]: [[1.2 Scrum Guide|Scrum Guide (2020)]]
## Product Backlog and Nexus

In the [[N1.1 Nexus framework|Nexus framework]], there is still one [[4.1 Product Backlog|Product Backlog]] for all [[1.5 Scrum Team|Scrum Teams]][^nexus-po].

[^nexus-po]: "A Nexus works off a single Product Backlog, and as described in Scrum, a Product Backlog has a single Product Owner who has the final say on its contents. The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product and the work performed and integrated by the Scrum Teams in a Nexus. The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Nexuses, Scrum Teams, and individuals."[^nexus-guide-2021]
